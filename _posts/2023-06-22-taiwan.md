# Coffee on top of Tapei 101
During my visit in Taipei, I tried Simple Kaffa. The founder, Wu, won the World Barista Championship in 2016. Simple Kaffa offers gourmet coffee beans from rare source in small batches. Most interestingly, it serves coffee that is grown locally in Taiwan.

Sitting by the window facing north; you can see Sun Yat Sen Memorial Hall, Taipei Dome, and Taipei Songshan Airport. If you don't work here at Taipei 101, this gorgeous view is very enjoyable and worth the minimal spending requirement.

Simple Kaffa has multiple locations, and this one - Simple Kaffa Sola - is on the 88th floor of Taipei 101. To reach here, you will enter Taipei 101 from the office entrance (not the shopping mall) and talk to the reception desk.

Outstanding coffee roasted and brewed with high standard. The desserts are impressive, too.
