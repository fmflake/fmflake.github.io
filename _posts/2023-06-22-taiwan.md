# Coffee on top of Tapei 101
During my visit in Taipei, I tried Simple Kaffa. The founder, Wu, won the World Barista Championship in 2016. Simple Kaffa offers gourmet coffee beans from rare source in small batches. Most interestingly, it serves coffee that is grown locally in Taiwan.

Simple Kaffa has multiple locations, and this one - Simple Kaffa Sola - is on the 88th floor of Taipei 101. To reach here, you will enter Taipei 101 from the office entrance (not the shopping mall) and talk to the reception desk.

Sitting by the window facing north; you can see Sun Yat Sen Memorial Hall, Taipei Dome, and Taipei Songshan Airport. If you don't work here at Taipei 101, this gorgeous view is very enjoyable and worth the minimal spending requirement.
Outstanding coffee roasted and brewed with high standard. The desserts are impressive, too.

# North East Coast  
Beiguan was established a fort in the Qing dynasty of China. You can still see ancient battery guns located in the park. There is a loop trail in the park for an easy walk.
