# Matanuska Glacier  
A guided tour and the hosts take you to and from the glacier with a snowmobile-driven sled. In winter you can walk on icy surface when Matanuska Glacier is frozen. I brought trekking poles but actually it was not needed because they give ice cleats to everyone. You can hear the cracking sound from the glacier movement when the surrounding is quite. You can also see that huge ice blocks being pushed upwards by the glacier. You read about this from your geography textbook but standing on a glacieris a totally different level of experience.

# Chena Hot Spring Resort  
Hot spring, dogsled and ice fishing
The hot spring is awesome. The infrastructure needs some renewal, but the soaking in the hot spring with your hair and ears frozen is pretty cool. First time riding a dogsled. It is a short and fun ride and the huskies are cute. The ice fishing trip is fun, too. We sat in a warm cabin on top of a frozen lake holding a tiny fishing rod over a hole drilled into the ice. I can see those fish swimming but they did not bite the bait. Suddenly an animal - not fish - swim up to my ice hole. It is a muskrat swimming up the ice hole and try to breath! The small critter even came up three times.

# Aurora  
In Chena Hot Spring Resort, you can book a trip for aurora viewing in a warm, cozy yurt with hot drink and ramen. This is a much more comfortable and a preferred way of watching the northern light. I've also tried another tour where you ride a van all night long and chase the aurora all over the place - it is very exhausting and cold. My ice-fishing tour guide recommanded me to use an app called "Amazing Aurora", which shows several important metrics on the same screen and is pretty accurate.  
Seeing aurora is a life time experience. The glowing sky and the bitter cold reminds me of how life is a short journey and I need to keep learning about the nature's wonder.

# Whittier
Whittier is a very unique, isolated small town. Used to be accessed only by the sea, now people can drive to Whittier through a long single-lane tunnel below a mountain. The tunnel follows a timetable and switch its driving direction. The entire town essentially live in one apartment building. I visited Whitter in winter and there is no activity going on. It feels like the entire town is frozen and stopped in time.
