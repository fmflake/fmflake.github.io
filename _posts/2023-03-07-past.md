I feel weird when I read my own writings from the past. It was like those posts are written by someone else -- my younger self. Sometimes I could hardly remember that I wrote those sentences. "What I was thinking at that moment?" I wondered. I could not remember the detail, but there must be some reason. At least it is important enough for me to write things down.

Did I grow smarter or gain wisdom compared to my younger self? It is debatable. I certainly have more experiences now. I keep evolving, absorbing new ideas, learning new skills. Perhaps this is why I could not recognize the younger me. And maybe it is a good sign.
