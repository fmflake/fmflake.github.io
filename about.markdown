**Useful Log** is built using Jekyll static site generator with [Swiss theme](https://github.com/broccolini/swiss), hosted by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). I use GIMP to edit all photos on a PC running Fedora.

*2023-06-22* After upgrading the Fedora, somehow my Jekyll refuse to run. It turns out that I need to install some more gems. I am glad that I could fix it quickly.
